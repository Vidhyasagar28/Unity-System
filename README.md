# Unity-System
In this repo, im uploading working unity codes, which are reusable. This includes Design Patterns, Input System logics, etc.

Added a Input Logic
-This is a sample code for Unity's New Input System which uses Singleton pattern and Event driven approach for inputs. This makes it Reusable ,Scalable and Decoupled and can be easily ued in any projects.

Added a Player Controller script
- this is a character controller based movement with gravity and jump logic applied, movement in respect to camera. includes crouch, sprint and other actions.

Added a Camera Controller script
- third person camera script with player follow, view and camera collisions handled.

Added a Sample State Machine design pattern code
- design pattern that lets an object switch between different states of behavior, where only one state is active at a time. It comes handy when we switch animations and its easily scalable.
